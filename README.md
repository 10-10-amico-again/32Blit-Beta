    Backstory: One man's vision and mission to be the 4th major console in the video gaming market by targeting it's 'big gaping hole', a console for the casual, none gamers called- amico. founded by Tommy Tallarico and his company intellivision entertainment, with over 600 years of industry experience... what could possibly go wrong!!    Allegedly...  while being president, CEO, and CCO (game designer, producer and musician), he befriended Youtubers and spoke on many podcasts to spread his message of 'together again', '10 commandments' and 'simple, affordable, family, entertainment'. he claimed to be open and transparent but spoke in vague and non committal terms and wasn't always clear, leaving the audience with more questions then answers... and all this attracted criticism. Tommy being a legendary industry professional, chose to publicly lash out and his new friends would parrot his words and behavior... fueling a 'micro influencer' culture war!   

    üòÉ now choose a side, your favorite personality and see how long you can last in peak Amico madness!
